# OpenCollaborativeDesignResearch

## In this repository we aim to test and experiment with some ideas:

1. How collaborative, agile and open best practices can be used to research about design.
2. Document and work from within a design community observing practitioners how they design and do things.
3. Try to understand the impact and developments of open collaboration, how it is evolving what advancements it has made, what limitations, potential and issues currently presents.

## Outcomes

1. Science about open design and collaborative activties.
2. Recommendations for designers and organizations to transfer responsibly the practices studied.
